    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">The most common website security threats are Cross-Site Scripting (XXS), SQL injection, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
        XXS describes a malicious script successfully penetrating a website via the browser. The best defense is to remove or disable any markup that could run code. For HTML this would include elements like script, object, embed, and link.
        SQL entails sending malicious data into the database via the browser. To avoid this sort of attack, one most ensure that any user data that is passed to an SQL query cannot change the nature of the query. 
        XSRF happens when an attacker tricks a user into executing an action unintentionally via a client. One way to prevent this is for the server to require that POST requests include a user-specific site-generated secret. This secret would be supplied by the server when sending web forms.</p>
